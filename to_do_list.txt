To Do
	Update design protocol
		--Design both protease and peptide
		Different sampling protocols
			--Original manual loop
			--FastDesign
			FlexPepDock
			Backrub
			Others?
		Adjust residue selection
			--Ignore prime region of peptide
			Differential selection based on side chain length?
		--What's up with residue scores?
		Improve output
			Aggregate mutation info across all models vs mutations specific to peptides
				Common vs rare vs situational
				Connection between mutation and specific residue in peptide sequence?
				Look at residue type, not just letter
			Combine current scripts
			Collect residue mutation propensity
			--Change mutations output to make columns match, separate start/end/energy change 
			Add sequence change classification, compared to cannonical sequences?
		--Increase decoy count
		Borrow from WIll's script to ditch CST files

	From viewed AEPDIR_1
		Back-convert res 56 to Q
		V93 to glutamate when AEPDI<b>R</b>
			Run a few models to see how that goes
		Glutamate --> lysine was good
		D183K was good w/ asp 4 of peptide
		Lysine on prime side doesn't matter

	Find cannonical (HCV) sequences 
		Didn't find in Manasi'd paper (4?)
		**** Lin, Chao 2006 **** --> which is ours?

		Charge before CS?
		Compare residue types in designed sequences against these

	Review 2-side (prot + pep) deisgns
		How does FastDesign compare with earlier protocol
			Space of mutations, energies, etc.

	Fix up MFPred

Ideas
	Test full cut/uncut list w/base HCV protease, search for correlation patterns with extracted data. Sort of like Manasi's paper.
		Total score
		ddG
		Interface residue scores
		Interface residue pair-scores
		Scaling by residue mutation propensity?
	Getting a sense of cleavage efficiency for known cleaved, vs. different Rosetta scores
	Would be nice if movemap worked with residue selectors

Literature to seek
	* HTRA protease--has PDZ and protease
		How to model two-domain + substrate in near-attack
	* Compare a-synuclein and tau papers 
	Neurosin or cathepsin expression
